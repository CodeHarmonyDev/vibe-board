# Migration Index

This index points to the migration planning documents for the Rust -> Convex backend migration:

1. Findings and architecture analysis:
- [migration-finding.md](./migration-finding.md)

2. Implementation task plan:
- [migration-task.md](./migration-task.md)

3. Authentication migration (Clerk):
- [migration-auth.md](./migration-auth.md)

Use `migration-finding.md` as the source of truth for current-state behavior and invariants, `migration-task.md` as the execution checklist, and `migration-auth.md` for the auth-specific track.
